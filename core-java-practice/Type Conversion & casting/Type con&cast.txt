We can not change the type of the variables but we can assign value to a type

eg. byte b = 127; max value
int a = 256;
b=a; // will not work
a=b; // will work    type a has a bigger range so data may be loose but b has less so it works 
                     even if a is less it will not work
b=(byte)a; //conversion of value (This is casting(explicit))  a=b; converion implicit 

another example 
int x = 5.6; this will not work
float f = 5.6f;
int x = (int)f; we will loose point value after conversion
