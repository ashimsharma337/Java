Component 
The Component is a fundamental block of Angular and multiple components will make up our application. 
A component in Angular is made up of three main parts—the template, styles, and the class. 
For example, app.component.ts, app.component.html, and app.component.css together constitute the AppComponent. 
This structure separates the logic, view, and styles so that the application is more maintainable and scalable.

app.module.ts:       Specifies the files that the application uses. 
                     This file acts as a central hub for the other files in your application.
app.component.ts:    Also known as the class, contains the logic for the application's main page.
app.component.html:  Contains the HTML for AppComponent. 
                     The contents of this file are also known as the template.
                     The template determines the view or what you see in the browser.
app.component.css:   Contains the styles for AppComponent. 
                     You use this file when you want to define styles that only apply to a specific component, 
                     as opposed to your application overall.

The Angular CLI also generates a file for component testing called app.component.spec.ts.
