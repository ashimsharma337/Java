In a simple words java annotations are supplements to the compiler.
(It is also a meta data which is extra information provided to compiler or runtime)

Java Annotation is a tag that represents the metadata 
i.e. attached with class, interface, methods or fields 
to indicate some additional information which can be used by java compiler and JVM.

Annotations in Java are used to provide additional information, 
so it is an alternative option for XML and Java marker interfaces.

In core java we don't use annotations that much 
Once, we start working with frameworks e.g Hibernate, Spring which are driven with annotation 

annotation can be 
-class level(e.g @Deprecated, @Entity) 
-method level(e.g @SuppressWarnings, @deprecatedmethod())
