Docker is a popular open source containerization tool used to provide a portable and consistent 
runtime environment for software applications, 
while consuming less resources than a traditional server or virtual machine. 


Dockerfile → (Build) → Image → (Run) → Container.

Dockerfile: contains a set of Docker instructions that provisions your operating system the way you like, 
and installs/configure all your software.

Image: compiled Dockerfile. Saves you time from rebuilding the Dockerfile 
every time you need to run a container. And it's a way to hide your provision code.

Container: the virtual operating system itself. You can ssh into it and run any commands you wish, 
as if it's a real environment. You can run 1000+ containers from the same Image. 

Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images where we can push or pull image.

some useful docker command 
 docker run --name [container name] -d [image name]

// for interactive container 
docker run --name [container name] -it -d [image name] 

// how to enter into the container 
   docker exec -it [container name] [command]
// how to get all information about the container 
   docker inspect [container id]

// how to stop container 
   docker stop [container id or name] 
// how to remove container 
   docker rm [container id]
// how to remove images 
   docker rmi [image name]
// how to restart container 
   docker restart [container name]
// how to push image to docker hub
   docker login 
   docker commit -- helps in creating, editing container in the local systems
   docker push -- helps in pushing images form local system to docker hub 
   docker copy -- copy file form docker hub to local system 
   docker logs -- checking the log 
          docker logs [container name]
   docker volume -- docker uses to create space to store data 
   docker logout -- login out from docker hub

// creating docker images
1. create a folder 
2. create a docker file inside that folder 
3. build image
    docker build -t [image name] .
    docker build -t [image name] . [inside folder containing docker file]
    docker run --name [container name] -it -p 8080:8080 -d [image name] {mapping port}
