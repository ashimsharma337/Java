What is AWS? 
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a Comprehensive cloud computing platform delivering on demand, online technology services.
- The cloud services offered are computer hardware and software.

Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms 
and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis. 

What is the cloud?
- Ondemand online computer resources.
- Server located in provider's datacenters.
- A datacenter is a building or space dedicated to housing many computers 
- The cloud is someone else's computer 

Benifits of Cloud 
- Reduced responsibility (AWS manages everything)
- Decentralzed (helps in case of failure)
- Increased speed and agility 
- Stop guessing capacity 
- Cost! 
     - Capex vs Opex 
     - Pay as you go 


Traditional Computing vs Cloud Computing 

Traditional Computing                                          Cloud Computing 
- Order physical parts and servers                       - Request logical components 
- Long wait times                                        - Instantaneous delivery 
- Control all elements of process                        - Reduction in responsibility 
- Risk of waste                                          - Request exactly what you need 
- Up front costs                                         - Pay as you go 

Type of Cloud Computing Services 
- There are three main types of cloud services: Iaas, Pass, and SaaS 
- On premises solutions are traditional datacenters solutions that are built and maintained on site 
- Cloud computing removes the responsibility of maintaining the hardware and networking 

Iaas ( Infrastructure as a Service )
- AWS manages physical hardware, you control everything else 
- Maximum control 
- "bare metal"/OS only 
E.g AWS EC2, VPC, EBS.
(DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, AWS, Cisco Metapod, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine(GCE))

PaaS ( Platform as a Service )
- Platform as a Service 
- Standard software, configured as needed 
- Ready to go service. No access to infrastructure 
 e.g AWS: Elastic Beanstalk, Cloud Formation, Lambda, RDS, S3 
 (Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, OpenShift)

SaaS ( Software as a Service )
- Pre-packaged software procvided "as-is" by the vendor 
- Email, chat clients, apps, etc 
- AWS can be used to create SaaS Solutions 
e.g WhatsApp, Google Maps, DocuSign, Slack 
( Google Workspace, Dropbox, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx, Concur, GoToMeeting ) 

There are three types of deployment model 
On premises: the legacy IT option. This approach gives us full controll 
Cloud: Fully deployed in the cloud. Not responsible for maintaining any hardware 
Hybrid: Deployment between cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure. Connects the cloud to internal systems.
