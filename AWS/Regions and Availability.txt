Global Infrastructure 
AWS global infrastructure: 
    - Regions 
    - Local Zones 
    - Availability Zones 
    - Edge Locations 

Regions: 
- Regions are locations around the world where there is a cluster of data centers. Each group of data centers is an 
  Availability Zone. Each Region consists of multiple physically separate AZ's within a geographic area. Each AZ 
  has its own power, cooling, security, and is connected by redundant, ultra-low-latency networks. 
- We can design our applications to run in multiple AZ's to achieve high availiblity. 
- Local Zones are new and rare, AZ's are common. It is an extension of current region into a highly densely populated area. 
High Availibility: 
- A Highly Available system is a system that is dependable and has been constructed anticipating failure.
- Failures happen - we have power outages, part malfunctions, etc. Which is why it's important to make our systems 
  redundant across multiple AZ's 
- Multi AZ ensures our systems are running in multiple locations on multiple servers. If an entire AZ goes down, our services 
  will still be available to our users. Each AZ has one or more datacenter 
- Edge Locations (PoP: Points of Presence)
  An Edge Location is a datacenter typically located away from regions, where files (html, CSS, picture, etc) are copied/cached 
  We can copy our files onto edge locations so it's closer to our users for faster delivery 
  Edge locations are the backbone of the AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN) 
  - Temporarily copying files onto edge locations is a process called caching 
  - Cached files have a time-to-live (TTL) before they expire 
  - This TTL ensures that as you update files on your application, the cached files get updated too 
  - Forcing an update to the cache is called 'cache invalidation'
