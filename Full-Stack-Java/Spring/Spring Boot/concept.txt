Features of SpringBoot:
Convention over Configuration - In older versions of spring we have lot of XML configuration to do to run the app.
we spend lot of time looking at the documentation and copy pasting boiler plate configuration.  
In spring boot we get default configuration for our project. We can also change default in application.property file.
Spring boot automatically configures all of the basics that we need form pom.xml file which is called auto configuration. 
Spring boot application is run with the class with @SpringBootApplication which run Ioc container and auto configuring application.
Another feature of spring boot is that it creates an embedded Tomcat server for us. In modern application we don't rely 
on big bulky servers like Weblogic or WebSphere. We deploy a lightweight Web server inside the app itself.


Spring Boot is an open-source micro framework maintained by a company called Pivotal. 
It provides Java developers with a platform to get started with an auto configurable production-grade 
Spring application. With it, developers can get started quickly without losing time on preparing 
and configuring their Spring application.

Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring framework, 
and it comes with many dependencies that can be plugged into the Spring application. 
Some examples are Spring Kafka, Spring LDAP, Spring Web Services, and Spring Security. 
However, developers have to configure each building brick themselves using a lot of XML configuration files or annotations.
