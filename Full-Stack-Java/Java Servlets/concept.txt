Servlet 
A Servlet is a small java program that runs within a Web server. 
Servlets receive and respond to requests from Web clients, usually across HTTP. 

Execution of Servlets basically involves six basic steps: 

The clients send the request to the webserver.
The web server receives the request.
The web server passes the request to the corresponding servlet.
The servlet processes the request and generates the response in the form of output.
The servlet sends the response back to the webserver.
The web server sends the response back to the client and the client browser displays it on the screen.

The Servlet technology is similar to other Web server extensions such as 
Common Gateway Interface(CGI) scripts(C, C++),
Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP),
Expressjs(Node) e.t.c

We can use servlets to create APIs that serve up raw data to client machines and other server-side applications. 
Alternatively, we can have a servlet generate a page using JSP, JSF, or similar server-side rendering frameworks.
