Ajax 
Ajax itself is mostly a generic term for various JavaScript techniques used 
to connect to a web server dynamically without necessarily loading multiple pages. 
In a more narrowly-defined sense, 
it refers to the use of XmlHttpRequest objects to interact with a web server dynamically via JavaScript.

Ajax is commonly used in web applications to implement features such as auto-complete search fields, real-time chat 
and dynamic forms. It has become an essentail tool in modern web development, and many popular JavaScript libraries 
such as jQuery, React, and Angular include built-in support for Ajax.

// create an XHR object
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()

// listen for `onload` event
xhr.onload = () => {
  // process response
  if (xhr.status == 200) {
    // parse JSON data
    console.log(JSON.parse(xhr.response))
  } else {
    console.error('Error!')
  }
}

// create a `GET` request
xhr.open('GET', 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')

// send request
xhr.send()

NOTE: Old browsers use the xhr.onreadystatechange instead of xhr.onload 

Servlet 
A servlet is simply a class which responds to a particular type of network request - most commonly an HTTP request. 
Basically servlets are usually used to implement web applications 
- but there are also various frameworks which operate on top of servlets (e.g. Struts) 
to give a higher-level abstraction than the "here's an HTTP request, write to this HTTP response" level 
which servlets provide.
Servlets run in a servlet container which handles the networking side (e.g. parsing an HTTP request, 
connection handling etc). One of the best-known open source servlet containers is Tomcat.

How does the Container know which Servlet client has requested for?

-Thereâ€™s a file called web.xml
-This is the master file for a web container
-You have information about servlet in this file-

servlets
    Servlet-name
    Servlet-class
servlet-mappings- the path like /Login or /Notifications is mapped here in
    Servlet-name
    url-pattern
and so on
-Every servlet in the web app should have an entry into this file

So this lookup happens like- url-pattern -> servlet-name -> servlet-class
How to "install" Servlets? * Well, the servlet objects are inherited from the library- javax.servlet.* . 
Tomcat and Spring can be used to utilize these objects to fit the use case.

Servlet can be deployed on any web server that supports the java Servlet API, such as Apache Tomcat, Jetty, 
or JBoss. They are often used in conjunction with JavaServer Pages (JSPs) to create dynamic web appplications 
using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
