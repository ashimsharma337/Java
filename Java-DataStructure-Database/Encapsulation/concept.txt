Encapsulation is the process of wrapping related state/behavior in a single unit.


Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) 
together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, 
and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

To achieve encapsulation in Java âˆ’

Declare the variables of a class as private.

Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

for e.g 
      class Person {
        private int age;
        private string name;

        public void code () {}

        public int setAge(age) {
            this.age = age;
        }

        public int getAge(age) {
            return age;
        }

      }
