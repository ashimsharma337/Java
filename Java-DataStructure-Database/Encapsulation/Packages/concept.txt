Packages 
- Packages are folder that bundles related classes 
- So, Encapsulation doesn't apply to single class but also multiple classes 
- Typically "reverse" domain name 
     - com.example.project 
- Packages provide a fully-qualified class name 
     - Avoids naming collisions 
     - com.example.project.Message != net.tutorial.Message 
- Packages are a hierarchial structure 

- The first line of a class must be the package statement 
- We can import classes into another class using import key word
