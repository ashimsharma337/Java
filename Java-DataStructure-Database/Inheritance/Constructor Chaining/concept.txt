Constructor Chaining 

- Every class in Java inherits from java.lang.Object 
- Without defining a superclass, extends Object is implied 
- The first line of a constructor must be a call to super or this 
                 - Super()    -- by default 
- Calling a constructor causes a chain of constructors to fire 
               variable                               variable used
    Object<---Employee<---Software Professsional<---Java developer 

    we can change this default behavior by declaring super or this by ourselves 
       
       No Args constructor 
    public Java Developer() {}      implicitly calling super 

    public Java Developer (String name) {
        this();                     call No Args java developer instead of super 
    }
