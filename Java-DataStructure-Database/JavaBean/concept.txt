JavaBeans 
     - The 'beans' of JavaBeans are classes that encapsulates one or more object into a single standard object(the bean).
     - A JavaBean is a POJO that is serilazable, has a no-argument constructor, and alllows access to properties 
       using getter and setter method that follow a simple naming convention 

     Advantage:
       -The properties, events and methods of a bean can be exposed to another application
       -A bean may register to receive events from other objects 
        and can generate events that are sent to those other objects 
       -The configuration settings of a bean can be saved to persistent storage and restored 

The following shows an example of a JavaServer Faces(JSF) component having bidirectional binding to a POJO's property

    <h:inputText value = "{MyBean.someProperty}"/>

    The definition of the POJO can be as follows 

    public class MyBean {

        private String someProperty;

        public String getSomeProperty() {
            return someProperty;
        }

        public void setSomeProperty(String someProperty) {
            this.someProperty = someProperty;
        }
    }
