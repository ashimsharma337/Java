Polymorphism 
- The ability for objects to be used very flexibly 
- Covariance and Virtual Method Invocation 
        -How Java handles overridden methods 
- Covariant assignment must pass the Is-A check 

class Animal               --------->   class Dog
void speak() {}                         void speak() {}

public void pet(Animal animal) {
        animal.speak();
}

Making dog object, and refrencing Animal class virtually dog object will overide the method on heap memory.
