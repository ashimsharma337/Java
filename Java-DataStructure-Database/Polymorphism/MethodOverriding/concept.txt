Method Overriding 
- Method with the same signature as one in a parent class 
         public void speak(){}
- Allows us to change behavior in a specialized class 
- No matter the reference type, the right method is called 
     - Due to Virtual method Invocatoin 
- Takes precedence over the superclass method 
     Note: only non-static methods can be overridden 

- Java will always look into the heap to call a method 

e.g 
   class Animal      --------------------------->     class Dog
   void speak() {}                                  void speak() {}
