Exception Handling 

Exceptions 
Exceptional events that occur in the the code at runtime 
- Reading a corrupted file 
- Network connection failure 
- Division by zero 
- Calling method without an object 
- Every Exception has a type 

All exceptions inherits from the throwable class 

Checked exceptions
 - Compiler forces us to handle this exceptions 
     e.g - IOException (corrupted file)
         - ConnectException (error in connection)

Unchecked exception 
     e.g - ArthmeticException (Division by zero)
         - NullPointerException 


In stack, if it does not find the handler stack will terminate. Using handler stack can keep on running 

Handler is a try catch block 
  try {
    // risky code
  } catch (ConnectException e) {
    // recovery procedure 
  }
