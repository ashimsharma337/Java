Algorithms 
 Algorithms are pieces of reusable functionality provided by java. They come form the collections class
 and mostly operate on List instances.

Bubble Sort 
   Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through a  list, compares adjacent elements 
   and swaps them if they are in the wrong order until the list is solved.
   - Basic (not very efficient) sorting algorithm
   - Sort numbers from least to greatest 
   - Good introduction into algorithms in general 
   - Sorts data by comparing adjacent elements 
   - Pushes higher numbers to the end 
   - The higher numbers "bubble" up.

      5->3->10->8--------------------------------3->5->8->10
                     This is complex 

Time Complexity 
We measure complexity using algebraic equation called Big O-Notation 
- Big O-Notation 
      - An algebraic equation that represents the time complexity
      - O(N*N) == O(N^2)


Big O is used to give an idea of how fast an algorithm will scale as input size increases

O(1) means that as input size increases, the running time will not change

O(n) means that as input size doubles, the running time will double, more or less

O(n^2) means that as input size double, the running time will quadruple, more or less

O(f(n)) means that as input size doubles, the running time will increase to around f(2n)

O(1):

for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {
   System.out.println(i);
}

O(n):

int n = 1000000; /* Some arbitrary large number */    
for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
   System.out.println(i);
}

O(n2):

int n = 1000000; /* Some arbitrary large number */    
for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
   for (int j=0; j<n; j++) {
      System.out.println(i * j);
   }
}
