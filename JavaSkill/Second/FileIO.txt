java I/O (Input and Output) is used to process the input and produce the output.
Java uses the concept of a stream to make I/O operation fast. 
The java.io package contains all the classes required for input and output operations.

We can perform file handling in Java by Java I/O API.

Stream
A stream is a sequence of data. In Java, a stream is composed of bytes. 
It's called a stream because it is like a stream of water that continues to flow.

In Java, 3 streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with the console.

1) System.out: standard output stream

2) System.in: standard input stream

3) System.err: standard error stream
