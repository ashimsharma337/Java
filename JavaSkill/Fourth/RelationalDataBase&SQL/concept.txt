Relational Model 
- Relational Database organize data into tables 
- A table is also called an entity or a relation 
- Table defines the columns 
- columns are also called fields or attributes 
- We add rows to the table, which holds the data
- Rows are called records or tuples 


            ID                       NAME            SALARY 
             1                      Dan              60,000
             2                      Howard           20,000 

IN OOP terms; 
    A table is a class 
    A column is an instance variable 
    A row is an instance (object)
