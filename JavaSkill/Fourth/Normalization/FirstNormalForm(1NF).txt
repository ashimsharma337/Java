First Normal Form (1NF)
A relation is in first normal form (1NF) if (and only if):

Each attribute contains only one value.
All attribute values are atomic, which means they can’t be broken down into anything smaller.

In practice, 1NF means that you should not have lists or other composite structures as attribute values. 
Below is an example of a relation that does not satisfy 1NF criteria:

Student courses

student	                                  courses
Jane Smith	                       Databases, Mathematics
John Lipinsky	                   English Literature, Databases
Dave Beyer	                       English Literature, Mathematics

This relation is not in 1NF because the courses attribute has multiple values. 
Jane Smith is assigned to two courses (Databases and Mathematics), 
and they are stored in one field as a comma-separated list. 
This list can be broken down into smaller elements 
(i.e. course subjects: databases as one element, mathematics as another), so it’s not an atomic value.

To transform this relation to the first normal form, 
we should store each course subject as a single value, 
so that each student-course assignment is a separate tuple:

Student courses

student	                                       course
Jane Smith	                                 Databases
Jane Smith	                                 Mathematics
John Lipinsky	                             English Literature
John Lipinsky	                             Databases
Dave Beyer	                                 English Literature
Dave Beyer	                                 Mathematics


- No repeating groups(multi-valued column)
               - Only one value per column 
- Table must be define a primary key 
               - A unique identifier for a row 
- Given a data set, you find a candidate keys 
               - A resonable choice for a primary key 
               - A candidate key is a minimal set of attributes that determines the other attributes 
                 included in the relation. It’s minimal in that if you removed one attribute, 
                 the remaining attributes do not form a candidate key
- If none exit, create one called a surrogate key
