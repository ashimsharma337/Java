Default implementation of equals() class provided by java.lang.Object 
compares memory location and only return true if two reference variable are pointing 
to same memory location i.e. essentially they are same object.

Java recommends to override equals and hashCode method if equality 
is going to be defined by logical way or via some business logic: 

example:
many classes in Java standard library does override it 
e.g. String overrides equals, whose implementation of equals() method return true 
if content of two String objects are exactly same

Integer wrapper class overrides equals to perform numerical comparison etc.
