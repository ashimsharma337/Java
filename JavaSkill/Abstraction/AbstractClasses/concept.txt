Abstract Classes 
- Abstract classes are partially built classes 
- Methods defined abstract do not need a method body 
- May have zero to many abstract methods 
- class must be declared as abstract to allow abstract methods 
- Abstract classes can not be instantiated 
- Abstract classes can extend other abstract classes 
           abstract class Shape {
                   abstract double area();
           }
