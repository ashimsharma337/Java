Interfaces 

- Interfaces are purely 100% abstract 
- Define a contract that classes follow 
- Usually used to established the behavior for an API 
- Interface methods are implicitly public abstract 
- Classses can implement many interfaces 
- Abstract class (what it is), Interface (what it does)

interface Drawable {
    void draw();
}

class Shape implements Drawable {
    void draw() {.......}                // over-ride the draw method, and defining its own draw method how to draw shape
}
