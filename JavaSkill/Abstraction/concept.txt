Abstraction 
- Building partial or incomplete classes 
- Create a foundation for other classes 
- Generalizations group shared functionality into a parent 
- Create classes without knowing how they're to be implemented 
- Abstraction can be achieved by abstract classes and interface 


e.g 

Shape                         ---------->          Traingle 
public abstract                                   double a,b,c
double area()                                      public double 
                                                   area() {}
