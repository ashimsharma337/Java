Set 
A set is a collection that can-not contain duplicate elements 
and adds a stronger contract on the behavaior of the equals 
and hashCode operations. It allows set instances to be 
compared meaningfully even if their implementation types.

Three general purpose set implementation 
1. HashSet 
2. TreeSet 
3. LinkedHashSet 

HashSet 
- A class in the collections API 
- Stores unique objects-duplicates are not allowed 
- Order of elements is not guaranted 
- No index available unlike List 
- HashSet stores values inside of a HashMap 

e.g set.add("Dan");                               Key         Value 
    set.add("Dan);                               Dan          Present 
    set.add(""Kim);                              Kim          Present
