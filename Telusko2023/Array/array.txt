Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets

String[] cars;

To insert values to it, you can place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces

String[] cars = {"BMW", "Ford", "Toyota", "Honda"};

for an array of integers, we can write 

int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};
To fetch number 20, we can write myNum[1]

Arrays has index number which start from 0

once we define the size of an array we have to stick to it 
for example,
    int num1[] = new int[4];     where 4 is the size which will have 4 values we can not change it.

Multi-Dimensional Array
       A multidimensional array is an array of arrays.

       int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
       
       System.out.println(myNumbers[1][2]); // Outputs 7

       Multidimensional arrays are useful when you want
       to store data as a tabular form, like a table with rows and columns.


Draw backs of Array
1. Size is fixed so there is a chance of memory wastage

2. Insertion and deletion operations on arrays can be slow,
as they require shifting elements to make room for new elemwnts
or close the gap left by deleted elements.

3. It can store a single type of primitives only.

Collections will can be used to overcome the draw backs of array. Both are useful depending on conditions.
