Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets

String[] cars;

To insert values to it, you can place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces

String[] cars = {"BMW", "Ford", "Toyota", "Honda"};

for an array of integers, we can write 

int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};
To fetch number 20, we can write myNum[1]

Arrays has index number which start from 0

once we define the size of an array we have to stick to it 
for example,
    int num1[] = new int[4];     where 4 is the size which will have 4 values we can not change it.

Multi-Dimensional Array
       A multidimensional array is an array of arrays.

       int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
       
       System.out.println(myNumbers[1][2]); // Outputs 7

       Multidimensional arrays are useful when you want
       to store data as a tabular form, like a table with rows and columns.
